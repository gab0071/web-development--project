## Working with forms and validation!!
Live Demo 💥: https://cheery-dusk-15e1d0.netlify.app/

Hi Guys!! 👋

I want to show you a web development project that I have carried out, with the purpose of those who want to practice these topics on their own.

## In this project the tools I used were:

````
1️⃣ JavaScript
2️⃣ HTML 
3️⃣ CSS
````

## ````I have commented in the code, some errors that I had and how I solved them.````

# What is this project about 🤔

## I created a basic form in HTML and wrote all the functions I wanted it to have in Javascript and styled it a bit with CSS.

# Purpose with which I did it: 🌟

## ````To practice topics like: ````

````
1️⃣ DOM
2️⃣ querySelector()
3️⃣ for...in loop
4️⃣ addEventListener()
5️⃣ if and else conditionals
6️⃣ Arrays
7️⃣ ParseInt()
8️⃣ Submit and onsubmit
9️⃣ innerHTML
🔟 trim()
1️⃣1️⃣ isNaN()
1️⃣2️⃣ Callback Funtion
````  

## Feel free to do them if you want to improve even more in programming and if you are a beginner, these exercises will be very helpful. 💯

# A little advice for you:

## I usually use "Prettier" to improve my code and make it look cleaner. It is also super useful for those who are starting to program. I know that when we are beginners in writing code, we usually make mistakes or our code looks messier and we can't read it ourselves.


# Prettier definition
## ``Prettier`` offers support for multiple languages and frameworks. What ``Prettier`` offers is to take your code and "re-format" it based on the defined settings thus maintaining a consistent style. Making it much more readable and without worrying about how you write it initially.
